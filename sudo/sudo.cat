       ssssuuuuddddoooo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the
       superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers
       file.  The real and effective uid and gid are set to match
       those of the target user as specified in the passwd file
       (the group vector is also initialized when the target user
       is not root).  By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo requires that users
       authenticate themselves with a password (NOTE: this is the
       user's password, not the root password).  Once a user has
       been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user
       may then use sudo without a password for a short period of
       time (five minutes by default).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo determines who is an authorized user by consulting
       the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  By giving ssssuuuuddddoooo the -v flag a user
       can update the time stamp without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_.  The
       password prompt itself will also time out if the user's
       password is not entered with N minutes (again, this is
       defined at configure time and defaults to 5 minutes).

       If a user that is not listed in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file tries to
       run a command via ssssuuuuddddoooo, mail is sent to the proper
       authorities, as defined at configure time (defaults to
       root).  Note that the mail will not be sent if an
       unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v
       flags.  This allows users to determine for themselves
       whether or not they are allowed to use ssssuuuuddddoooo.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo can log both successful an unsuccessful attempts (as
       well as errors) to _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), a log file, or both.  By
       default ssssuuuuddddoooo will log via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) but this is changeable
       at configure time.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo accepts the following command line options:

       -V  The -V (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the
           version number and exit.

       -l  The -l (_l_i_s_t) option will list out the allowed (and
           forbidden) commands for the user on the current host.

       -L  The -L (_l_i_s_t defaults) option will list out the
           parameters that may be set in a _D_e_f_a_u_l_t_s line along
           with a short description for each.  This option is
           useful in conjunction with _g_r_e_p(1).

       -h  The -h (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print a usage
           message and exit.

       -v  If given the -v (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssssuuuuddddoooo will update
           the user's timestamp, prompting for the user's
           password if necessary.  This extends the ssssuuuuddddoooo timeout
           to for another N minutes (where N is defined at
           installation time and defaults to 5 minutes) but does
           not run a command.

       -k  The -k (_k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo invalidates the user's
           timestamp by setting the time on it to the epoch.  The
           next time ssssuuuuddddoooo is run a password will be required.
           This option does not require a password and was added
           to allow a user to revoke ssssuuuuddddoooo permissions from a
           .logout file.

       -K  The -K (sure _k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo removes the user's
           timestamp entirely.  This option does not require a
           password.

       -b  The -b (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the given
           command in the background.  Note that if you use the
           -b option you cannot use shell job control to
           manipulate the command.

       -p  The -p (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the
           default password prompt and use a custom one.  If the
           password prompt contains the %u escape, %u will be
           replaced with the user's login name.  Similarly, %h
           will be replaced with the local hostname.

       -c  The -c (_c_l_a_s_s) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the specified
           command with resources limited by the specified login
           class.  The _c_l_a_s_s argument can be either a class name
           as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single '-'
           character.  Specifying the _c_l_a_s_s as '-' means that the
           command should be run restricted by the default login
           capibilities of the user the command is run as.  If
           the _c_l_a_s_s argument specifies an existing user class,
           the command must be run as root, or the ssssuuuuddddoooo command
           must be run from a shell that is already root.  This
           option is only available on systems with BSD login
           classes where ssssuuuuddddoooo has been configured with the
           --with-logincap option.

       -u  The -u (_u_s_e_r) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the specified
           command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
           instead of a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, use "#uid".

       -s  The -s (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the
           _S_H_E_L_L environment variable if it is set or the shell
           as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).

       -H  The -H (_H_O_M_E) option sets the _H_O_M_E environment
           variable to the homedir of the target user (root by
           default) as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).  By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo
           does not modify _H_O_M_E.

       -S  The -S (_s_t_d_i_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to read the password
           from standard input instead of the terminal device.

       --  The -- flag indicates that ssssuuuuddddoooo should stop processing
           command line arguments.  It is most useful in
           conjunction with the -s flag.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot execute
       the given command.  In the latter case the error string is
       printed to stderr.  If ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot _s_t_a_t(2) one or more
       entries in the user's PATH an error is printed on stderr.
       (If the directory does not exist or if it is not really a
       directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
       This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The
       most common reason for _s_t_a_t(2) to return "permission
       denied" is if you are running an automounter and one of
       the directories in your PATH is on a machine that is
       currently unreachable.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo tries to be safe when executing external commands.
       Variables that control how dynamic loading and binding is
       done can be used to subvert the program that ssssuuuuddddoooo runs.
       To combat this the LD_*, _RLD_*, SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only),
       and LIBPATH (AIX only) environment variables are removed
       from the environment passed on to all commands executed.
       ssssuuuuddddoooo will also remove the IFS, ENV, BASH_ENV, KRB_CONF,
       KRB5_CONFIG, LOCALDOMAIN, RES_OPTIONS and HOSTALIASES
       variables as they too can pose a threat.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssssuuuuddddoooo checks "." and "" (both
       denoting current directory) last when searching for a
       command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the
       PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH environment
       variable is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that ssssuuuuddddoooo executes.

       For security reasons, if your OS supports shared libraries
       and does not disable user-defined library search paths for
       setuid programs (most do), you should either use a linker
       option that disables this behavior or link ssssuuuuddddoooo
       statically.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
       (_/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o by default) and ignore the directory's
       contents if it is not owned by root and only writable by

       files via _c_h_o_w_n(2), if the timestamp directory is located
       in a directory writable by anyone (eg: _/_t_m_p), it is
       possible for a user to create the timestamp directory
       before ssssuuuuddddoooo is run.  However, because ssssuuuuddddoooo checks the
       ownership and mode of the directory and its contents, the
       only damage that can be done is to "hide" files by putting
       them in the timestamp dir.  This is unlikely to happen
       since once the timestamp dir is owned by root and
       inaccessible by any other user the user placing files
       there would be unable to get them back out.  To get around
       this issue you can use a directory that is not world-
       writable for the timestamps (_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_s_u_d_o for instance)
       or create _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o with the appropriate owner (root)
       and permissions (0700) in the system startup files.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will not honor timestamps set far in the future.
       Timestamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 *
       TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.
       This is done to keep a user from creating his/her own
       timestamp with a bogus date on system that allow users to
       give away files.

       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them
       from creating their own program that gives them a root
       shell regardless of any '!'  elements in the user
       specification.
