       ssssuuuuddddoooo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the
       superuser or another user, as specified in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
       file.  The real and effective uid and gid are set to match
       those of the target user as specified in the passwd file
       (the group vector is also initialized when the target user
       is not root).  By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo requires that users
       authenticate themselves with a password (NOTE: by default
       this is the user's password, not the root password).  Once
       a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and
       the user may then use sudo without a password for a short
       period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s).

       ssssuuuuddddoooo determines who is an authorized user by consulting
       the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  By giving ssssuuuuddddoooo the ----vvvv flag a user
       can update the time stamp without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_. The
       password prompt itself will also time out if the user's
       password is not entered within 5 minutes (unless overrid­
       den via _s_u_d_o_e_r_s).

       If a user who is not listed in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file tries to
       run a command via ssssuuuuddddoooo, mail is sent to the proper author­
       ities, as defined at configure time or the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file
       (defaults to root).  Note that the mail will not be sent
       if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the ----llll or
       ----vvvv flags.  This allows users to determine for themselves
       whether or not they are allowed to use ssssuuuuddddoooo.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as
       well as errors) to _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), a log file, or both.  By
       default ssssuuuuddddoooo will log via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) but this is changeable
       at configure time or via the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo accepts the following command line options:

       -V  The ----VVVV (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print the ver­
           sion number and exit.  If the invoking user is already
           root the ----VVVV option will print out a list of the
           defaults ssssuuuuddddoooo was compiled with as well as the
           machine's local network addresses.

       -l  The ----llll (_l_i_s_t) option will list out the allowed (and
           forbidden) commands for the user on the current host.

       -L  The ----LLLL (_l_i_s_t defaults) option will list out the param­
           eters that may be set in a _D_e_f_a_u_l_t_s line along with a
           short description for each.  This option is useful in
           conjunction with _g_r_e_p(1).

       -h  The ----hhhh (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to print a usage mes­
           sage and exit.

       -v  If given the ----vvvv (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssssuuuuddddoooo will update
           the user's timestamp, prompting for the user's pass­
           word if necessary.  This extends the ssssuuuuddddoooo timeout for
           another 5 minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to
           in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s) but does not run a command.

       -k  The ----kkkk (_k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo invalidates the user's
           timestamp by setting the time on it to the epoch.  The
           next time ssssuuuuddddoooo is run a password will be required.
           This option does not require a password and was added
           to allow a user to revoke ssssuuuuddddoooo permissions from a
           .logout file.

       -K  The ----KKKK (sure _k_i_l_l) option to ssssuuuuddddoooo removes the user's
           timestamp entirely.  Likewise, this option does not
           require a password.

       -b  The ----bbbb (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the given
           command in the background.  Note that if you use the
           ----bbbb option you cannot use shell job control to manipu­
           late the process.

       -p  The ----pppp (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the
           default password prompt and use a custom one.  If the
           password prompt contains the %u escape, %u will be
           replaced with the user's login name.  Similarly, %h
           will be replaced with the local hostname.

       -c  The ----cccc (_c_l_a_s_s) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the specified
           command with resources limited by the specified login
           class.  The _c_l_a_s_s argument can be either a class name
           as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single '-' charac­
           ter.  Specifying a _c_l_a_s_s of - indicates that the com­
           mand should be run restricted by the default login
           capabilities for the user the command is run as.  If
           the _c_l_a_s_s argument specifies an existing user class,
           the command must be run as root, or the ssssuuuuddddoooo command
           must be run from a shell that is already root.  This
           option is only available on systems with BSD login
           classes where ssssuuuuddddoooo has been configured with the
           --with-logincap option.

       -a  The ----aaaa (_a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _t_y_p_e) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to use
           the specified authentication type when validating the
           user, as allowed by /etc/login.conf.  The system
           administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific

           authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry
           in /etc/login.conf.  This option is only available on
           systems that support BSD authentication where ssssuuuuddddoooo has
           been configured with the --with-bsdauth option.

       -u  The ----uuuu (_u_s_e_r) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to run the specified
           command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
           instead of a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, use _#_u_i_d.

       -s  The ----ssss (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the
           _S_H_E_L_L environment variable if it is set or the shell
           as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).

       -H  The ----HHHH (_H_O_M_E) option sets the HOME environment vari­
           able to the homedir of the target user (root by
           default) as specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).  By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo
           does not modify HOME.

       -P  The ----PPPP (_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _g_r_o_u_p _v_e_c_t_o_r) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to
           preserve the user's group vector unaltered.  By
           default, ssssuuuuddddoooo will initialize the group vector to the
           list of groups the target user is in.  The real and
           effective group IDs, however, are still set to match
           the target user.

       -S  The ----SSSS (_s_t_d_i_n) option causes ssssuuuuddddoooo to read the password
           from standard input instead of the terminal device.

       --  The -------- flag indicates that ssssuuuuddddoooo should stop processing
           command line arguments.  It is most useful in conjunc­
           tion with the ----ssss flag.

       Upon successful execution of a program, the return value
       from ssssuuuuddddoooo will simply be the return value of the program
       that was executed.

       Otherwise, ssssuuuuddddoooo quits with an exit value of 1 if there is
       a configuration/permission problem or if ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot exe­
       cute the given command.  In the latter case the error
       string is printed to stderr.  If ssssuuuuddddoooo cannot _s_t_a_t(2) one
       or more entries in the user's PATH an error is printed on
       stderr.  (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
       really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is
       printed.)  This should not happen under normal circum­
       stances.  The most common reason for _s_t_a_t(2) to return
       "permission denied" is if you are running an automounter
       and one of the directories in your PATH is on a machine
       that is currently unreachable.

       To combat this the LD_*, _RLD_*, SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only),
       and LIBPATH (AIX only) environment variables are removed
       from the environment passed on to all commands executed.
       ssssuuuuddddoooo will also remove the IFS, ENV, BASH_ENV, KRB_CONF,
       KRBCONFDIR, KRBTKFILE, KRB5_CONFIG, LOCALDOMAIN,
       RES_OPTIONS, HOSTALIASES, NLSPATH, PATH_LOCALE, TERMINFO,
       TERMINFO_DIRS and TERMPATH variables as they too can pose
       a threat.  If the TERMCAP variable is set and is a path­
       name, it too is ignored.  Additionally, if the LC_* or
       LANGUAGE variables contain the / or % characters, they are
       ignored.  If ssssuuuuddddoooo has been compiled with SecurID support,
       the VAR_ACE, USR_ACE and DLC_ACE variables are cleared as
       well.  The list of environment variables that ssssuuuuddddoooo clears
       is contained in the output of sudo -V when run as root.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssssuuuuddddoooo checks "." and "" (both
       denoting current directory) last when searching for a com­
       mand in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).
       Note, however, that the actual PATH environment variable
       is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the program
       that ssssuuuuddddoooo executes.

       For security reasons, if your OS supports shared libraries
       and does not disable user-defined library search paths for
       setuid programs (most do), you should either use a linker
       option that disables this behavior or link ssssuuuuddddoooo stati­
       cally.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
       (_/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o by default) and ignore the directory's con­
       tents if it is not owned by root and only writable by
       root.  On systems that allow non-root users to give away
       files via _c_h_o_w_n(2), if the timestamp directory is located
       in a directory writable by anyone (e.g.: _/_t_m_p), it is pos­
       sible for a user to create the timestamp directory before
       ssssuuuuddddoooo is run.  However, because ssssuuuuddddoooo checks the ownership
       and mode of the directory and its contents, the only dam­
       age that can be done is to "hide" files by putting them in
       the timestamp dir.  This is unlikely to happen since once
       the timestamp dir is owned by root and inaccessible by any
       other user the user placing files there would be unable to
       get them back out.  To get around this issue you can use a
       directory that is not world-writable for the timestamps
       (_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_s_u_d_o for instance) or create _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o with
       the appropriate owner (root) and permissions (0700) in the
       system startup files.

       ssssuuuuddddoooo will not honor timestamps set far in the future.
       Timestamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 *
       TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.
       This is done to keep a user from creating his/her own
       timestamp with a bogus date on systems that allow users to
       give away files.

       Please note that ssssuuuuddddoooo will only log the command it explic­
       itly runs.  If a user runs a command such as sudo su or
       sudo sh, subsequent commands run from that shell will _n_o_t
       be logged, nor will ssssuuuuddddoooo's access control affect them.
       The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes
       (including most editors).  Because of this, care must be
       taken when giving users access to commands via ssssuuuuddddoooo to
       verify that the command does not inadvertantly give the
       user an effective root shell.

       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root
       shell if that user has access to commands allowing shell
       escapes.

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them
       from creating their own program that gives them a root
