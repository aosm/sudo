       The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is composed of two types of entries:
       aliases (basically variables) and user specifications
       (which specify who may run what).  The grammar of _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
       will be described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form
       (EBNF).  Don't despair if you don't know what EBNF is; it
       is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.

       QQQQuuuuiiiicccckkkk gggguuuuiiiiddddeeee ttttoooo EEEEBBBBNNNNFFFF

       EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar
       of a language.  Each EBNF definition is made up of _p_r_o_d_u_c_­
       _t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e_s.  E.g.,

        symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...

       Each _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e references others and thus makes up a
       grammar for the language.  EBNF also contains the follow­
       ing operators, which many readers will recognize from reg­
       ular expressions.  Do not, however, confuse them with
       "wildcard" characters, which have different meanings.

       ?       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) is optional.  That is, it may appear once or
               not at all.

       *       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) may appear zero or more times.

       +       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) may appear one or more times.

       Parentheses may be used to group symbols together.  For
       clarity, we will use single quotes ('') to designate what
       is a verbatim character string (as opposed to a symbol
       name).

       There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.

        Alias ::= 'User_Alias'  User_Alias (':' User_Alias)* |
                  'Runas_Alias' Runas_Alias (':' Runas_Alias)* |
                  'Host_Alias'  Host_Alias (':' Host_Alias)* |
                  'Cmnd_Alias'  Cmnd_Alias (':' Cmnd_Alias)*

        User_Alias ::= NAME '=' User_List

        Runas_Alias ::= NAME '=' Runas_List

        Host_Alias ::= NAME '=' Host_List

        Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME '=' Cmnd_List

        NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*

       Each _a_l_i_a_s definition is of the form

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...

       where _A_l_i_a_s___T_y_p_e is one of User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       Host_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias.  A NAME is a string of upper­
       case letters, numbers, and the underscore characters
       ('_').  A NAME mmmmuuuusssstttt start with an uppercase letter.  It is
       possible to put several alias definitions of the same type
       on a single line, joined by a colon (':').  E.g.,

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4, item5

       The definitions of what constitutes a valid _a_l_i_a_s member
       follow.

        User_List ::= User |
                      User ',' User_List

        User ::= '!'* username |
                 '!'* '%'group |
                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* User_Alias

       A User_List is made up of one or more usernames, uids
       (prefixed with '#'), System groups (prefixed with '%'),
       netgroups (prefixed with '+') and other aliases.  Each
       list item may be prefixed with one or more '!' operators.
       An odd number of '!' operators negate the value of the
       item; an even number just cancel each other out.

        Runas_List ::= Runas_User |
                       Runas_User ',' Runas_List

        Runas_User ::= '!'* username |
                       '!'* '#'uid |
                       '!'* '%'group |
                       '!'* +netgroup |
                       '!'* Runas_Alias

       A Runas_List is similar to a User_List except that it can
       also contain uids (prefixed with '#') and instead of
       User_Aliases it can contain Runas_Aliases.

        Host_List ::= Host |
                      Host ',' Host_List

        Host ::= '!'* hostname |
                 '!'* ip_addr |
                 '!'* network(/netmask)? |
                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* Host_Alias

       A Host_List is made up of one or more hostnames, IP
       addresses, network numbers, netgroups (prefixed with '+')
       and other aliases.  Again, the value of an item may be
       negated with the '!' operator.  If you do not specify a
       netmask with a network number, the netmask of the host's
       ethernet _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e(s) will be used when matching.  The
       netmask may be specified either in dotted quad notation
       (e.g.  255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (number of bits,
       e.g. 24).  A hostname may include shell-style wildcards
       (see `Wildcards' section below), but unless the hostname
       command on your machine returns the fully qualified host­
       name, you'll need to use the _f_q_d_n option for wildcards to
       be useful.

        Cmnd_List ::= Cmnd |
                      Cmnd ',' Cmnd_List

        commandname ::= filename |
                        filename args |
                        filename '""'

        Cmnd ::= '!'* commandname |
                 '!'* directory |
                 '!'* Cmnd_Alias

       A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more commandnames, direc­
       tories, and other aliases.  A commandname is a fully qual­
       ified filename which may include shell-style wildcards
       (see `Wildcards' section below).  A simple filename allows
       the user to run the command with any arguments he/she
       wishes.  However, you may also specify command line argu­
       ments (including wildcards).  Alternately, you can specify
       "" to indicate that the command may only be run wwwwiiiitttthhhhoooouuuutttt
       command line arguments.  A directory is a fully qualified
       pathname ending in a '/'.  When you specify a directory in
       a Cmnd_List, the user will be able to run any file within
       that directory (but not in any subdirectories therein).

       If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the
       arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by
       the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if
       there are any).  Note that the following characters must
       be escaped with a '\' if they are used in command argu­
       ments: ',', ':', '=', '\'.

       Certain configuration options may be changed from their
       default values at runtime via one or more Default_Entry
       lines.  These may affect all users on any host, all users
       on a specific host, or just a specific user.  When multi­
       ple entries match, they are applied in order.  Where there
       are conflicting values, the last value on a matching line
       takes effect.

        Default_Type ::= 'Defaults' ||
                         'Defaults' ':' User ||
                         'Defaults' '@' Host

        Default_Entry ::= Default_Type Parameter_List

                      Parameter '+=' Value ||
                      Parameter '-=' Value ||
                      '!'* Parameter ||

       Parameters may be ffffllllaaaaggggssss, iiiinnnntttteeeeggggeeeerrrr values, ssssttttrrrriiiinnnnggggssss, or
       lllliiiissssttttssss.  Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off
       via the '!'  operator.  Some integer, string and list
       parameters may also be used in a boolean context to dis­
       able them.  Values may be enclosed in double quotes (")
       when they contain multiple words.  Special characters may
       be escaped with a backslash (\).

       Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and -=.
       These operators are used to add to and delete from a list
       respectively.  It is not an error to use the -= operator
       to remove an element that does not exist in a list.

       Note that since the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is parsed in order the
       best place to put the Defaults section is after the Host,
       User, and Cmnd aliases but before the user specifications.

                   used to make it easier to cut and paste the

       mail_no_user
                   If set, mail will be sent to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user
                   if the invoking user is not in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s

                   if the invoking user exists in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
                   file, but is not allowed to run commands on
                   the current host.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       mail_no_perms
                   If set, mail will be sent to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user
                   if the invoking user allowed to use ssssuuuuddddoooo but
                   the command they are trying is not listed in
                   their _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file entry.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       tty_tickets If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty
                   basis.  Normally, ssssuuuuddddoooo uses a directory in the
                   ticket dir with the same name as the user run­
                   ning it.  With this flag enabled, ssssuuuuddddoooo will
                   use a file named for the tty the user is
                   logged in on in that directory.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

                   the first time he/she runs ssssuuuuddddoooo.  This flag is
                   _o_n by default.

       authenticate
                   If set, users must authenticate themselves via
                   a password (or other means of authentication)
                   before they may run commands.  This default
                   may be overridden via the PASSWD and NOPASSWD
                   tags.  This flag is _o_n by default.

       root_sudo   If set, root is allowed to run ssssuuuuddddoooo too.  Dis­
                   abling this prevents users from "chaining"
                   ssssuuuuddddoooo commands to get a root shell by doing
                   something like "sudo sudo /bin/sh".  This flag

                   the (non-syslog) ssssuuuuddddoooo log file.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

       shell_noargs
                   If set and ssssuuuuddddoooo is invoked with no arguments
                   it acts as if the ----ssss flag had been given.
                   That is, it runs a shell as root (the shell is
                   determined by the SHELL environment variable
                   if it is set, falling back on the shell listed
                   in the invoking user's /etc/passwd entry if
                   not).  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       set_home    If set and ssssuuuuddddoooo is invoked with the ----ssss flag
                   the HOME environment variable will be set to
                   the home directory of the target user (which
                   is root unless the ----uuuu option is used).  This
                   effectively makes the ----ssss flag imply ----HHHH.  This
                   flag is _o_f_f by default.

       always_set_home
                   If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will set the HOME environment
                   variable to the home directory of the target
                   user (which is root unless the ----uuuu option is
                   used).  This effectively means that the ----HHHH
                   flag is always implied.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       path_info   Normally, ssssuuuuddddoooo will tell the user when a com­
                   mand could not be found in their PATH environ­
                   ment variable.  Some sites may wish to disable
                   this as it could be used to gather information
                   on the location of executables that the normal
                   user does not have access to.  The disadvan­
                   tage is that if the executable is simply not
                   in the user's PATH, ssssuuuuddddoooo will tell the user
                   that they are not allowed to run it, which can
                   be confusing.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       preserve_groups
                   By default ssssuuuuddddoooo will initialize the group vec­
                   tor to the list of groups the target user is
                   in.  When _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e___g_r_o_u_p_s is set, the user's
                   existing group vector is left unaltered.  The
                   real and effective group IDs, however, are
                   still set to match the target user.  This flag
                   is _o_f_f by default.

                   you wish (and even mix the two).  Beware that
                   turning on _f_q_d_n requires ssssuuuuddddoooo to make DNS
                   lookups which may make ssssuuuuddddoooo unusable if DNS
                   stops working (for example if the machine is
                   not plugged into the network).  Also note that
                   you must use the host's official name as DNS
                   knows it.  That is, you may not use a host
                   alias (CNAME entry) due to performance issues
                   and the fact that there is no way to get all
                   aliases from DNS.  If your machine's hostname
                   (as returned by the hostname command) is
                   already fully qualified you shouldn't need to
                   set _f_q_d_n.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       insults     If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will insult users when they enter
                   an incorrect password.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       requiretty  If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will only run when the user is
                   logged in to a real tty.  This will disallow
                   things like "rsh somehost sudo ls" since
                   _r_s_h(1) does not allocate a tty.  Because it is
                   not possible to turn of echo when there is no
                   tty present, some sites may with to set this
                   flag to prevent a user from entering a visible
                   password.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       env_editor  If set, vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo will use the value of the EDI­
                   TOR or VISUAL environment variables before
                   falling back on the default editor list.  Note
                   that this may create a security hole as it
                   allows the user to run any arbitrary command
                   as root without logging.  A safer alternative
                   is to place a colon-separated list of editors
                   in the editor variable.  vvvviiiissssuuuuddddoooo will then only
                   use the EDITOR or VISUAL if they match a value
                   specified in editor.  This flag is off by
                   default.

       rootpw      If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will prompt for the root password
                   instead of the password of the invoking user.
                   This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       runaspw     If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will prompt for the password of
                   the user defined by the _r_u_n_a_s___d_e_f_a_u_l_t option
                   (defaults to root) instead of the password of

       set_logname Normally, ssssuuuuddddoooo will set the LOGNAME and USER
                   environment variables to the name of the tar­
                   get user (usually root unless the ----uuuu flag is
                   given).  However, since some programs (includ­
                   ing the RCS revision control system) use LOG­
                   NAME to determine the real identity of the
                   user, it may be desirable to change this
                   behavior.  This can be done by negating the
                   set_logname option.

       stay_setuid Normally, when ssssuuuuddddoooo executes a command the
                   real and effective UIDs are set to the target
                   user (root by default).  This option changes
                   that behavior such that the real UID is left
                   as the invoking user's UID.  In other words,
                   this makes ssssuuuuddddoooo act as a setuid wrapper.  This
                   can be useful on systems that disable some
                   potentially dangerous functionality when a
                   program is run setuid.  Note, however, that
                   this means that sudo will run with the real
                   uid of the invoking user which may allow that
                   user to kill ssssuuuuddddoooo before it can log a failure,
                   depending on how your OS defines the interac­
                   tion between signals and setuid processes.

       env_reset   If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will reset the environment to
                   only contain the following variables: HOME,
                   LOGNAME, PATH, SHELL, TERM, and USER (in addi­
                   tion to the SUDO_* variables).  Of these, only
                   TERM is copied unaltered from the old environ­
                   ment.  The other variables are set to default
                   values (possibly modified by the value of the
                   _s_e_t___l_o_g_n_a_m_e option).  If ssssuuuuddddoooo was compiled
                   with the SECURE_PATH option, its value will be
                   used for the PATH environment variable.  Other
                   variables may be preserved with the _e_n_v___k_e_e_p
                   option.

       use_loginclass
                   If set, ssssuuuuddddoooo will apply the defaults specified
                   for the target user's login class if one
                   exists.  Only available if ssssuuuuddddoooo is configured
                   with the --with-logincap option.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

       loglinelen  Number of characters per line for the file
                   log.  This value is used to decide when to
                   wrap lines for nicer log files.  This has no
                   effect on the syslog log file, only the file
                   log.  The default is 80 (use 0 or negate the

                   Number of minutes that can elapse before ssssuuuuddddoooo
                   will ask for a passwd again.  The default is
                   5.  Set this to 0 to always prompt for a pass­
                   word.  If set to a value less than 0 the
                   user's timestamp will never expire.  This can
                   be used to allow users to create or delete
                   their own timestamps via sudo -v and sudo -k
                   respectively.

       passwd_timeout

                   prompt times out.  The default is 5, set this
                   to 0 for no password timeout.

       umask       Umask to use when running the command.  Negate
                   this option or set it to 0777 to preserve the

       run (and as what user) on specified hosts.  By default,
       commands are run as rrrrooooooootttt, but this can be changed on a
       per-command basis.

       Let's break that down into its constituent parts:

       RRRRuuuunnnnaaaassss____SSSSppppeeeecccc

       A Runas_Spec is simply a Runas_List (as defined above)
       enclosed in a set of parentheses.  If you do not specify a
       Runas_Spec in the user specification, a default Runas_Spec
       of rrrrooooooootttt will be used.  A Runas_Spec sets the default for
       commands that follow it.  What this means is that for the
       entry:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/who

       The user ddddggggbbbb may run _/_b_i_n_/_l_s, _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l, and _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m
       -- but only as ooooppppeeeerrrraaaattttoooorrrr.  E.g.,

           sudo -u operator /bin/ls.

       It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in
       an entry.  If we modify the entry like so:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

       Then user ddddggggbbbb is now allowed to run _/_b_i_n_/_l_s as ooooppppeeeerrrraaaattttoooorrrr,
       but  _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l and _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m as rrrrooooooootttt.

       By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo requires that a user authenticate him or
       herself before running a command.  This behavior can be
       modified via the NOPASSWD tag.  Like a Runas_Spec, the
       NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow
       it in the Cmnd_Spec_List.  Conversely, the PASSWD tag can
       be used to reverse things.  For example:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       would allow the user rrrraaaayyyy to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l, _/_b_i_n_/_l_s, and
       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m as root on the machine rushmore as rrrrooooooootttt
       without authenticating himself.  If we only want rrrraaaayyyy to be
       able to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l without a password the entry would
       be:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       Note, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on users
       who are in the group specified by the exempt_group option.

       By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the
       entries for a user on the current host, he or she will be
       able to run sudo -l without a password.  Additionally, a
       user may only run sudo -v without a password if the
       NOPASSWD tag is present for all a user's entries that per­
       tain to the current host.  This behavior may be overridden
       via the verifypw and listpw options.

       [!...]  Matches any character nnnnooootttt in the specified range.

       \x      For any character "x", evaluates to "x".  This is

       line arguments, however, as slash ddddooooeeeessss get matched by

       The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment (unless
       it occurs in the context of a user name and is followed by
       one or more digits, in which case it is treated as a uid).
       Both the comment character and any text after it, up to
       the end of the line, are ignored.

       The reserved word AAAALLLLLLLL is a built in _a_l_i_a_s that always
       causes a match to succeed.  It can be used wherever one
       might otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       or Host_Alias.  You should not try to define your own
       _a_l_i_a_s called AAAALLLLLLLL as the built in alias will be used in
       preference to your own.  Please note that using AAAALLLLLLLL can be
       dangerous since in a command context, it allows the user
       to run aaaannnnyyyy command on the system.

       An exclamation point ('!') can be used as a logical _n_o_t
       operator both in an _a_l_i_a_s and in front of a Cmnd.  This
       allows one to exclude certain values.  Note, however, that
       using a ! in conjunction with the built in ALL alias to
       allow a user to run "all but a few" commands rarely works
       as intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash ('\') as the
       last character on the line.

       Whitespace between elements in a list as well as special

       and 128.138.242.0).  Of those networks, only 128.138.204.0
       has an explicit netmask (in CIDR notation) indicating it
       is a class C network.  For the other networks in _C_S_N_E_T_S,
       the local machine's netmask will be used during matching.

       tenance.  Here, those are commands related to backups,
       killing processes, the printing system, shutting down the

        ALL            CDROM = NOPASSWD: /sbin/umount /CDROM,\
                       /sbin/mount -o nosuid\,nodev /dev/cd0a /CDROM

       Any user may mount or unmount a CD-ROM on the machines in
       the CDROM Host_Alias (orion, perseus, hercules) without
       entering a password.  This is a bit tedious for users to
       type, so it is a prime candidate for encapsulating in a
       shell script.

       It is generally not effective to "subtract" commands from
       ALL using the '!' operator.  A user can trivially circum­
       vent this by copying the desired command to a different
       name and then executing that.  For example:

           bill        ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS

       Doesn't really prevent bbbbiiiillllllll from running the commands
       listed in _S_U or _S_H_E_L_L_S since he can simply copy those com­
       mands to a different name, or use a shell escape from an
       editor or other program.  Therefore, these kind of
       restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and
       reinforced by policy).

       command which locks the file and does grammatical check­
       ing. It is imperative that _s_u_d_o_e_r_s be free of syntax
       errors since ssssuuuuddddoooo will not run with a syntactically incor­
       rect _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.

       When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users), if
       you store fully qualified hostnames in the netgroup (as is
       usually the case), you either need to have the machine's
       hostname be fully qualified as returned by the hostname
       command or use the _f_q_d_n option in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s.
