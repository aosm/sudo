DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is composed of two types of entries:
       aliases (basically variables) and user specifications
       (which specify who may run what).

       When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied
       in order.  Where there are conflicting values, the last
       match is used (which is not necessarily the most specific
       match).

       The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s grammar will be described below in Extended
       Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).  Don't despair if you don't know
       what EBNF is; it is fairly simple, and the definitions
       below are annotated.

       EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar
       of a language.  Each EBNF definition is made up of _p_r_o_d_u_c_­
       _t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e_s.  E.g.,

        symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...

       Each _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e references others and thus makes up a
       grammar for the language.  EBNF also contains the follow­
       ing operators, which many readers will recognize from reg­
       ular expressions.  Do not, however, confuse them with
       "wildcard" characters, which have different meanings.

       ?       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) is optional.  That is, it may appear once or
               not at all.

       *       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) may appear zero or more times.

       +       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of sym­
               bols) may appear one or more times.

       Parentheses may be used to group symbols together.  For
       clarity, we will use single quotes ('') to designate what
       is a verbatim character string (as opposed to a symbol
       name).

       There are four kinds of aliases: User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.

        Host_Alias ::= NAME '=' Host_List

        Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME '=' Cmnd_List

        NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*

       Each _a_l_i_a_s definition is of the form

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...

       where _A_l_i_a_s___T_y_p_e is one of User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       Host_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias.  A NAME is a string of upper­
       case letters, numbers, and underscore characters ('_').  A
       NAME mmuusstt start with an uppercase letter.  It is possible
       to put several alias definitions of the same type on a
       single line, joined by a colon (':').  E.g.,

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4, item5

       The definitions of what constitutes a valid _a_l_i_a_s member
       follow.

                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* User_Alias

       A User_List is made up of one or more usernames, system
       groups (prefixed with '%'), netgroups (prefixed with '+')
       and other aliases.  Each list item may be prefixed with
       one or more '!' operators.  An odd number of '!' operators
       negate the value of the item; an even number just cancel
       each other out.

       A Runas_List is similar to a User_List except that it can
       also contain uids (prefixed with '#') and instead of
       User_Aliases it can contain Runas_Aliases.  Note that
       usernames and groups are matched as strings.  In other
       words, two users (groups) with the same uid (gid) are con­
       sidered to be distinct.  If you wish to match all user­
       names with the same uid (e.g. root and toor), you can use
       a uid instead (#0 in the example given).

        Host_List ::= Host |
                      Host ',' Host_List

        Host ::= '!'* hostname |
                 '!'* ip_addr |
                 '!'* network(/netmask)? |
                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* Host_Alias

       A Host_List is made up of one or more hostnames, IP
       addresses, network numbers, netgroups (prefixed with '+')
       and other aliases.  Again, the value of an item may be
       negated with the '!' operator.  If you do not specify a
       netmask with a network number, the netmask of the host's
       ethernet interface(s) will be used when matching.  The
       netmask may be specified either in dotted quad notation
       (e.g.  255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (number of bits,
       e.g. 24).  A hostname may include shell-style wildcards
       (see the Wildcards section below), but unless the hostname
       command on your machine returns the fully qualified host­
       name, you'll need to use the _f_q_d_n option for wildcards to
       be useful.

        Cmnd_List ::= Cmnd |
                      Cmnd ',' Cmnd_List

        commandname ::= filename |
                        filename args |
                        filename '""'

        Cmnd ::= '!'* commandname |
                 '!'* directory |
                 '!'* "sudoedit" |
                 '!'* Cmnd_Alias

       A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more commandnames, direc­
       tories, and other aliases.  A commandname is a fully qual­
       ified filename which may include shell-style wildcards
       (see the Wildcards section below).  A simple filename
       allows the user to run the command with any arguments
       he/she wishes.  However, you may also specify command line
       arguments (including wildcards).  Alternately, you can
       specify "" to indicate that the command may only be run
       wwiitthhoouutt command line arguments.  A directory is a fully
       qualified pathname ending in a '/'.  When you specify a

       directory in a Cmnd_List, the user will be able to run any
       file within that directory (but not in any subdirectories
       therein).

       If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the
       arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by
       the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if
       there are any).  Note that the following characters must
       be escaped with a '\' if they are used in command argu­
       ments: ',', ':', '=', '\'.  The special command "sudoedit"
       is used to permit a user to run ssuuddoo with the --ee flag (or
       as ssuuddooeeddiitt).  It may take command line arguments just as
       a normal command does.

       Certain configuration options may be changed from their
       default values at runtime via one or more Default_Entry
       lines.  These may affect all users on any host, all users
       on a specific host, a specific user, or commands being run
       as a specific user.

        Default_Type ::= 'Defaults' |
                         'Defaults' '@' Host |

                      Parameter '-=' Value |
                      '!'* Parameter

       Parameters may be ffllaaggss, iinntteeggeerr values, ssttrriinnggss, or
       lliissttss.  Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off
       via the '!'  operator.  Some integer, string and list
       parameters may also be used in a boolean context to dis­
       able them.  Values may be enclosed in double quotes (")
       when they contain multiple words.  Special characters may
       be escaped with a backslash (\).

       Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and -=.
       These operators are used to add to and delete from a list
       respectively.  It is not an error to use the -= operator
       to remove an element that does not exist in a list.

                   pretty as the default but some people find it
                   more convenient.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       ignore_dot  If set, ssuuddoo will ignore '.' or '' (current
                   dir) in the PATH environment variable; the
                   PATH itself is not modified.  This flag is _o_f_f
                   by default.  Currently, while it is possible
                   to set _i_g_n_o_r_e___d_o_t in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, its value is not
                   used.  This option should be considered read-
                   only (it will be fixed in a future version of
                   ssuuddoo).

                   Send mail to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user if the user run­
                   ning sudo does not enter the correct password.
                   This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       mail_no_user
                   If set, mail will be sent to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user
                   if the invoking user is not in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
                   file.  This flag is _o_n by default.

       mail_no_host
                   If set, mail will be sent to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user
                   if the invoking user exists in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
                   file, but is not allowed to run commands on
                   the current host.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       mail_no_perms
                   If set, mail will be sent to the _m_a_i_l_t_o user
                   if the invoking user is allowed to use ssuuddoo
                   but the command they are trying is not listed
                   in their _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file entry or is explicitly
                   denied.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       tty_tickets If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty
                   basis.  Normally, ssuuddoo uses a directory in the
                   ticket dir with the same name as the user run­
                   ning it.  With this flag enabled, ssuuddoo will
                   use a file named for the tty the user is
                   logged in on in that directory.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

                   If set, users must authenticate themselves via
                   a password (or other means of authentication)
                   before they may run commands.  This default

                   may be overridden via the PASSWD and NOPASSWD
                   tags.  This flag is _o_n by default.

       root_sudo   If set, root is allowed to run ssuuddoo too.  Dis­
                   abling this prevents users from "chaining"
                   ssuuddoo commands to get a root shell by doing
                   something like "sudo sudo /bin/sh".  Note,
                   however, that turning off _r_o_o_t___s_u_d_o will also
                   prevent root and from running ssuuddooeeddiitt.  Dis­
                   abling _r_o_o_t___s_u_d_o provides no real additional
                   security; it exists purely for historical rea­
                   sons.  This flag is _o_n by default.

       log_host    If set, the hostname will be logged in the
                   (non-syslog) ssuuddoo log file.  This flag is _o_f_f
                   by default.

       log_year    If set, the four-digit year will be logged in
                   the (non-syslog) ssuuddoo log file.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

       shell_noargs
                   If set and ssuuddoo is invoked with no arguments
                   it acts as if the --ss flag had been given.
                   That is, it runs a shell as root (the shell is
                   determined by the SHELL environment variable
                   if it is set, falling back on the shell listed
                   in the invoking user's /etc/passwd entry if
                   not).  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       set_home    If set and ssuuddoo is invoked with the --ss flag
                   the HOME environment variable will be set to
                   the home directory of the target user (which
                   is root unless the --uu option is used).  This
                   effectively makes the --ss flag imply --HH.  This
                   flag is _o_f_f by default.

       always_set_home
                   If set, ssuuddoo will set the HOME environment
                   variable to the home directory of the target
                   user (which is root unless the --uu option is
                   used).  This effectively means that the --HH
                   flag is always implied.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       path_info   Normally, ssuuddoo will tell the user when a com­
                   mand could not be found in their PATH environ­
                   ment variable.  Some sites may wish to disable
                   this as it could be used to gather information
                   on the location of executables that the normal
                   user does not have access to.  The disadvan­
                   tage is that if the executable is simply not
                   in the user's PATH, ssuuddoo will tell the user
                   that they are not allowed to run it, which can

       preserve_groups
                   By default ssuuddoo will initialize the group vec­
                   tor to the list of groups the target user is
                   in.  When _p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e___g_r_o_u_p_s is set, the user's
                   existing group vector is left unaltered.  The
                   real and effective group IDs, however, are
                   still set to match the target user.  This flag
                   is _o_f_f by default.

                   fied hostnames in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.  I.e.,
                   instead of myhost you would use myhost.mydo­
                   main.edu.  You may still use the short form if
                   you wish (and even mix the two).  Beware that
                   turning on _f_q_d_n requires ssuuddoo to make DNS
                   lookups which may make ssuuddoo unusable if DNS
                   stops working (for example if the machine is
                   not plugged into the network).  Also note that
                   you must use the host's official name as DNS
                   knows it.  That is, you may not use a host
                   alias (CNAME entry) due to performance issues
                   and the fact that there is no way to get all
                   aliases from DNS.  If your machine's hostname
                   (as returned by the hostname command) is
                   already fully qualified you shouldn't need to
                   set _f_q_d_n.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       insults     If set, ssuuddoo will insult users when they enter
                   an incorrect password.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       requiretty  If set, ssuuddoo will only run when the user is
                   logged in to a real tty.  This will disallow
                   things like "rsh somehost sudo ls" since
                   _r_s_h(1) does not allocate a tty.  Because it is
                   not possible to turn off echo when there is no
                   tty present, some sites may with to set this
                   flag to prevent a user from entering a visible
                   password.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       env_editor  If set, vviissuuddoo will use the value of the EDI­
                   TOR or VISUAL environment variables before
                   falling back on the default editor list.  Note
                   that this may create a security hole as it
                   allows the user to run any arbitrary command
                   as root without logging.  A safer alternative
                   is to place a colon-separated list of editors
                   in the editor variable.  vviissuuddoo will then only
                   use the EDITOR or VISUAL if they match a value
                   specified in editor.  This flag is off by
                   default.

       rootpw      If set, ssuuddoo will prompt for the root password
                   instead of the password of the invoking user.
                   This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       runaspw     If set, ssuuddoo will prompt for the password of
                   the user defined by the _r_u_n_a_s___d_e_f_a_u_l_t option
                   (defaults to root) instead of the password of
                   the invoking user.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       targetpw    If set, ssuuddoo will prompt for the password of
                   the user specified by the --uu flag (defaults to
                   root) instead of the password of the invoking
                   user.  Note that this precludes the use of a
                   uid not listed in the passwd database as an
                   argument to the --uu flag.  This flag is _o_f_f by
                   default.

       set_logname Normally, ssuuddoo will set the LOGNAME and USER
                   environment variables to the name of the tar­
                   get user (usually root unless the --uu flag is
                   given).  However, since some programs (includ­
                   ing the RCS revision control system) use LOG­
                   NAME to determine the real identity of the
                   user, it may be desirable to change this
                   behavior.  This can be done by negating the
                   set_logname option.

       stay_setuid Normally, when ssuuddoo executes a command the
                   real and effective UIDs are set to the target
                   user (root by default).  This option changes
                   that behavior such that the real UID is left
                   as the invoking user's UID.  In other words,
                   this makes ssuuddoo act as a setuid wrapper.  This
                   can be useful on systems that disable some
                   potentially dangerous functionality when a
                   program is run setuid.  Note, however, that
                   this means that sudo will run with the real
                   uid of the invoking user which may allow that
                   user to kill ssuuddoo before it can log a failure,
                   depending on how your OS defines the interac­
                   tion between signals and setuid processes.

       env_reset   If set, ssuuddoo will reset the environment to
                   only contain the following variables: HOME,
                   LOGNAME, PATH, SHELL, TERM, and USER (in addi­
                   tion to the SUDO_* variables).  Of these, only
                   TERM is copied unaltered from the old environ­
                   ment.  The other variables are set to default
                   values (possibly modified by the value of the
                   _s_e_t___l_o_g_n_a_m_e option).  If ssuuddoo was compiled
                   with the SECURE_PATH option, its value will be
                   used for the PATH environment variable.  Other
                   variables may be preserved with the _e_n_v___k_e_e_p

                   If set, ssuuddoo will apply the defaults specified
                   for the target user's login class if one
                   exists.  Only available if ssuuddoo is configured
                   with the --with-logincap option.  This flag is
                   _o_f_f by default.

       noexec      If set, all commands run via sudo will behave
                   as if the NOEXEC tag has been set, unless
                   overridden by a EXEC tag.  See the description
                   of _N_O_E_X_E_C _a_n_d _E_X_E_C below as well as the "PRE­

                   this manual.  This flag is _o_f_f by default.

       ignore_local_sudoers
                   If set via LDAP, parsing of @sysconfdir@/sudo­
                   ers will be skipped.  This is intended for an
                   Enterprises that wish to prevent the usage of
                   local sudoers files so that only LDAP is used.
                   This thwarts the efforts of rogue operators
                   who would attempt to add roles to
                   @sysconfdir@/sudoers.  When this option is
                   present, @sysconfdir@/sudoers does not even
                   need to exist.  Since this options tells sudo
                   how to behave when no specific LDAP entries
                   have been matched, this sudoOption is only
                   meaningful for the cn=defaults section.  This
                   flag is _o_f_f by default.

       A uusseerr ssppeecciiffiiccaattiioonn determines which commands a user may
       run (and as what user) on specified hosts.  By default,
       commands are run as rroooott, but this can be changed on a
       per-command basis.

       Let's break that down into its constituent parts:

       RRuunnaass__SSppeecc

       A Runas_Spec is simply a Runas_List (as defined above)
       enclosed in a set of parentheses.  If you do not specify a
       Runas_Spec in the user specification, a default Runas_Spec
       of rroooott will be used.  A Runas_Spec sets the default for
       commands that follow it.  What this means is that for the
       entry:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

       The user ddggbb may run _/_b_i_n_/_l_s, _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l, and _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m
       -- but only as ooppeerraattoorr.  E.g.,

        $ sudo -u operator /bin/ls.

       It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in
       an entry.  If we modify the entry like so:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

       Then user ddggbb is now allowed to run _/_b_i_n_/_l_s as ooppeerraattoorr,
       but  _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l and _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m as rroooott.

       TTaagg__SSppeecc

       A command may have zero or more tags associated with it.
       There are four possible tag values, NOPASSWD, PASSWD,
       NOEXEC, EXEC.  Once a tag is set on a Cmnd, subsequent
       Cmnds in the Cmnd_Spec_List, inherit the tag unless it is
       overridden by the opposite tag (ie: PASSWD overrides
       NOPASSWD and EXEC overrides NOEXEC).

       _N_O_P_A_S_S_W_D _a_n_d _P_A_S_S_W_D

       By default, ssuuddoo requires that a user authenticate him or
       herself before running a command.  This behavior can be
       modified via the NOPASSWD tag.  Like a Runas_Spec, the
       NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow
       it in the Cmnd_Spec_List.  Conversely, the PASSWD tag can
       be used to reverse things.  For example:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       would allow the user rraayy to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l, _/_b_i_n_/_l_s, and
       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_l_p_r_m as root on the machine rushmore as rroooott
       without authenticating himself.  If we only want rraayy to be
       able to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l without a password the entry would
       be:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       Note, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on users
       who are in the group specified by the exempt_group option.

       By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the
       entries for a user on the current host, he or she will be
       able to run sudo -l without a password.  Additionally, a
       user may only run sudo -v without a password if the
       NOPASSWD tag is present for all a user's entries that per­
       tain to the current host.  This behavior may be overridden
       via the verifypw and listpw options.

       _N_O_E_X_E_C _a_n_d _E_X_E_C

       If sudo has been compiled with _n_o_e_x_e_c support and the
       underlying operating system support it, the NOEXEC tag can
       be used to prevent a dynamically-linked executable from

       See the "PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES" section below for more
       details on how _n_o_e_x_e_c works and whether or not it will
       work on your system.

       WWiillddccaarrddss

       ssuuddoo allows shell-style _w_i_l_d_c_a_r_d_s (aka meta or glob char­
       acters) to be used in pathnames as well as command line
       arguments in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.  Wildcard matching is done
       via the PPOOSSIIXX _f_n_m_a_t_c_h(3) routine.  Note that these are _n_o_t
       regular expressions.

       *       Matches any set of zero or more characters.

       ?       Matches any single character.

       [...]   Matches any character in the specified range.

       [!...]  Matches any character nnoott in the specified range.

       \x      For any character "x", evaluates to "x".  This is
               used to escape special characters such as: "*",
               "?", "[", and "}".

       Note that a forward slash ('/') will nnoott be matched by
       wildcards used in the pathname.  When matching the command
       line arguments, however, a slash ddooeess get matched by wild­
       cards.  This is to make a path like:

           /usr/bin/*

       match _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_w_h_o but not _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_X_1_1_/_x_t_e_r_m.

       WARNING: a pathname with wildcards will nnoott match a user
       command that consists of a relative path.  In other words,
       given the following _s_u_d_o_e_r_s entry:

           billy  workstation = /usr/bin/*

       user billy will be able to run any command in /usr/bin as
       root, such as _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_w.  The following two command will
       be allowed (the first assumes that _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n is in the
       user's path):

           $ sudo w
           $ sudo /usr/bin/w

       However, this will not:

       For this reason you should only ggrraanntt access to commands
       using wildcards and never rreessttrriicctt access using them.
       This limitation will be removed in a future version of

       The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment (unless
       it occurs in the context of a user name and is followed by
       one or more digits, in which case it is treated as a uid).
       Both the comment character and any text after it, up to
       the end of the line, are ignored.

       The reserved word AALLLL is a built-in _a_l_i_a_s that always
       causes a match to succeed.  It can be used wherever one
       might otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       or Host_Alias.  You should not try to define your own
       _a_l_i_a_s called AALLLL as the built-in alias will be used in
       preference to your own.  Please note that using AALLLL can be
       dangerous since in a command context, it allows the user
       to run aannyy command on the system.

       An exclamation point ('!') can be used as a logical _n_o_t
       operator both in an _a_l_i_a_s and in front of a Cmnd.  This
       allows one to exclude certain values.  Note, however, that
       using a ! in conjunction with the built-in ALL alias to
       allow a user to run "all but a few" commands rarely works
       as intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash ('\') as the
       last character on the line.

       Whitespace between elements in a list as well as special
       syntactic characters in a _U_s_e_r _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n ('=', ':',
       '(', ')') is optional.

       The following characters must be escaped with a backslash
       ('\') when used as part of a word (e.g. a username or
       hostname): '@', '!', '=', ':', ',', '(', ')', '\'.

       Since the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is parsed in a single pass, order
       is important.  In general, you should structure _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
       such that the Host_Alias, User_Alias, and Cmnd_Alias spec­
       ifications come first, followed by any Default_Entry

       Any user may mount or unmount a CD-ROM on the machines in

SSEECCUURRIITTYY NNOOTTEESS
       It is generally not effective to "subtract" commands from
       ALL using the '!' operator.  A user can trivially circum­
       vent this by copying the desired command to a different
       name and then executing that.  For example:

           bill        ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS

       Doesn't really prevent bbiillll from running the commands
       listed in _S_U or _S_H_E_L_L_S since he can simply copy those com­
       mands to a different name, or use a shell escape from an
       editor or other program.  Therefore, these kind of
       restrictions should be considered advisory at best (and
       reinforced by policy).

       Once ssuuddoo executes a program, that program is free to do
       whatever it pleases, including run other programs.  This
       can be a security issue since it is not uncommon for a
       program to allow shell escapes, which lets a user bypass
       ssuuddoo's restrictions.  Common programs that permit shell
       escapes include shells (obviously), editors, paginators,
       mail and terminal programs.

       Many systems that support shared libraries have the abil­
       ity to override default library functions by pointing an
       environment variable (usually LD_PRELOAD) to an alternate
       shared library.  On such systems, ssuuddoo's _n_o_e_x_e_c function­
       ality can be used to prevent a program run by sudo from
       executing any other programs.  Note, however, that this
       applies only to native dynamically-linked executables.

       running under binary emulation are not affected.

       To tell whether or not ssuuddoo supports _n_o_e_x_e_c, you can run
       the following as root:

           sudo -V | grep "dummy exec"

       If the resulting output contains a line that begins with:

           File containing dummy exec functions:

       then ssuuddoo may be able to replace the exec family of func­
       tions in the standard library with its own that simply
       return an error.  Unfortunately, there is no foolproof way
       to know whether or not _n_o_e_x_e_c will work at compile-time.
       _N_o_e_x_e_c should work on SunOS, Solaris, *BSD, Linux, IRIX,
       Tru64 UNIX, MacOS X, and HP-UX 11.x.  It is known nnoott to
       work on AIX and UnixWare.  _N_o_e_x_e_c is expected to work on
       most operating systems that support the LD_PRELOAD envi­
       ronment variable.  Check your operating system's manual
       pages for the dynamic linker (usually ld.so, ld.so.1,
       dyld, dld.sl, rld, or loader) to see if LD_PRELOAD is sup­
       ported.

       To enable _n_o_e_x_e_c for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as doc­
       umented in the User Specification section above.  Here is
       that example again:

        aaron  shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi

       This allows user aaaarroonn to run _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_m_o_r_e and
       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_v_i with _n_o_e_x_e_c enabled.  This will prevent those
       two commands from executing other commands (such as a
       shell).  If you are unsure whether or not your system is
       capable of supporting _n_o_e_x_e_c you can always just try it
       out and see if it works.

       Note that disabling shell escapes is not a panacea.  Pro­
       grams running as root are still capable of many poten­
       tially hazardous operations (such as changing or overwrit­
       ing files) that could lead to unintended privilege escala­
       tion.  In the specific case of an editor, a safer approach
       is to give the user permission to run ssuuddooeeddiitt.

       command which locks the file and does grammatical check­
       ing. It is imperative that _s_u_d_o_e_r_s be free of syntax
       errors since ssuuddoo will not run with a syntactically incor­
       rect _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.
