=head1 NAME

visudo - edit the sudoers file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<visudo> [ B<-s> ] [ B<-V> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<visudo> edits the I<sudoers> file in a safe fashion, analogous to
vipw(@mansectsu@).  B<visudo> locks the I<sudoers> file against multiple
simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks
for parse errors.  If the I<sudoers> file is currently being
edited you will receive a message to try again later.  In the
default configuration, the vi(1) editor is used, but there is
a compile time option to allow use of whatever editor the
environment variables C<EDITOR> or C<VISUAL> are set to.

B<visudo> parses the I<sudoers> file after the edit and will
not save the changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding
an error, a message will be printed stating the line number(s)
that the error occurred on and the user will receive the
"What now?" prompt.  At this point the user may enter "e"
to re-edit the I<sudoers> file, enter "x" to exit without
saving the changes, or "Q" to quit and save changes.  The
"Q" option should be used with extreme care because if B<visudo>
believes there to be a parse error, so will B<sudo> and no one
will be able to execute B<sudo> again until the error is fixed.
Any other command at this prompt will print a short help message.
When editing the I<sudoers> file after a parse error has been
detected the cursor will be placed on the line where the error
occurred (if the editor supports this feature).

=head1 OPTIONS

B<visudo> accepts the following command line option:

=over 4

=item -s

Enable B<strict> checking of the I<sudoers> file.  If an alias is
used before it is defined, B<visudo> will consider this a parse
error.  Note that it is not possible to differentiate between an
alias and a hostname or username that consists solely of upper case
letters, digits, and the underscore ('_') character.

=item -V

The C<-V> (version) option causes B<visudo> to print the version number
and exit.

=back

=head1 ERRORS

=over 4

=item sudoers file busy, try again later.

Someone else is currently editing the I<sudoers> file.

=item @sysconfdir@/sudoers.tmp: Permission denied

You didn't run B<visudo> as root.

=item Can't find you in the passwd database

Your userid does not appear in the system passwd file.

=item Warning: undeclared Alias referenced near ...

Either you are using a {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias before
defining it or you have a user or hostname listed that
consists solely of upper case letters, digits, and the
underscore ('_') character.  If the latter, you can ignore
the warnings (B<sudo> will not complain).  In B<-s> (strict)
mode these are errors not warnings.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are used only if B<visudo>
was configured with the I<--with-env-editor> option:

 EDITOR			Used by visudo as the editor to use
 VISUAL			Used by visudo if EDITOR is not set

=head1 FILES

 @sysconfdir@/sudoers		List of who can run what
 @sysconfdir@/sudoers.tmp	Lock file for visudo

=head1 AUTHOR

Many people have worked on I<sudo> over the years, this version of
B<visudo> was written by:

 Todd Miller		<Todd.Miller@courtesan.com>

See the HISTORY file in the sudo distribution for more details.

the editor used by B<visudo> allows shell escapes.
