.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsudoreplay\fR
plays back or lists the output logs created by
\fBsudo\fR.
When replaying,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
can play the session back in real-time, or the playback speed may be
adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command line options.
.PP
The
\fIID\fR
should be a six character sequence of digits and
upper case letters, e.g.\&
\fR0100A5\fR.
When a command is run via
\fBsudo\fR
with
\fIlog_output\fR
enabled in the
\fIsudoers\fR
file, a
\fRTSID=ID\fR
string is logged via syslog or to the
\fBsudo\fR
log file.
The
\fIID\fR
may also be determined using
\fBsudoreplay\fR's
list mode.
.PP
In list mode,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
can be used to find the ID of a session based on a number of criteria
such as the user, tty or command run.
.PP
In replay mode, if the standard output has not been redirected,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
will act on the following keys:
.TP 14n
`\fR\ \fR' (space)
Pause output; press any key to resume.
.TP 14n
`<'
Reduce the playback speed by one half.
.TP 14n
`>'
Double the playback speed.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 14n
\fB\-d\fR \fIdirectory\fR
.br
Use
\fIdirectory\fR
to for the session logs instead of the default,
\fI@iolog_dir@\fR.
.TP 14n
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilter\fR
By default,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
will play back the command's standard output, standard error and tty output.
The
\fB\-f\fR
option can be used to select which of these to output.
The
\fIfilter\fR
argument is a comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of following:
\fIstdout\fR,
\fIstderr\fR,
and
\fIttyout\fR.
.TP 14n
\fB\-h\fR
The
\fB\-h\fR (\fIhelp\fR)
option causes
\fBsudoreplay\fR
to print a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.TP 14n
\fB\-l\fR [\fIsearch expression\fR]
Enable
``list mode''.
In this mode,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
will list available sessions in a format similar to the
\fBsudo\fR
log file format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).
If a
\fIsearch expression\fR
is specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs that are displayed.
An expression is composed of the following predicates:
.RS
.TP 8n
command \fIpattern\fR
Evaluates to true if the command run matches
\fIpattern\fR.
On systems with POSIX regular expression support, the pattern may
be an extended regular expression.
On systems without POSIX regular expression support, a simple substring
match is performed instead.
.TP 8n
cwd \fIdirectory\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified current
working directory.
.TP 8n
fromdate \fIdate\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or after
\fIdate\fR.
See
\fIDate and time format\fR
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.TP 8n
group \fIrunas_group\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified
\fIrunas_group\fR.
Note that unless a
\fIrunas_group\fR
was explicitly specified when
\fBsudo\fR
was run this field will be empty in the log.
.TP 8n
runas \fIrunas_user\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run as the specified
\fIrunas_user\fR.
Note that
\fBsudo\fR
runs commands as user
\fIroot\fR
by default.
.TP 8n
todate \fIdate\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or prior to
\fIdate\fR.
See
\fIDate and time format\fR
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.TP 8n
tty \fItty name\fR
Evaluates to true if the command was run on the specified terminal device.
The
\fItty name\fR
should be specified without the
\fI/dev/\fR
prefix, e.g.\&
\fItty01\fR
instead of
\fI/dev/tty01\fR.
.TP 8n
user \fIuser name\fR
Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run by
\fIuser name\fR.
.PP
Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string (currently
all predicates may be shortened to a single character).
.sp
Predicates may be combined using
\fIand\fR,
\fIor\fR
and
\fI\&!\fR
operators as well as
`\&('
and
`\&)'
grouping (note that parentheses must generally be escaped from the shell).
The
\fIand\fR
operator is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied
\fIand\fR
unless separated by an
\fIor\fR.
.PP
.RE
.PD 0
.TP 14n
\fB\-m\fR \fImax_wait\fR
Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key presses or output data.
By default,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
will accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or program output.
However, this can be tedious when the session includes long pauses.
When the
\fB\-m\fR
option is specified,
\fBsudoreplay\fR
will limit these pauses to at most
\fImax_wait\fR
seconds.
The value may be specified as a floating point number, e.g.\&
\fI2.5\fR.
.PD
.TP 14n
\fB\-s\fR \fIspeed_factor\fR
This option causes
\fBsudoreplay\fR
to adjust the number of seconds it will wait between key presses or
program output.
This can be used to slow down or speed up the display.
For example, a
\fIspeed_factor\fR
of
\fI2\fR
would make the output twice as fast whereas a
\fIspeed_factor\fR
of
\fI.5\fR
would make the output twice as slow.
.TP 14n
\fB\-V\fR
The
\fB\-V\fR (\fIversion\fR)
option causes
\fBsudoreplay\fR
to print its version number
and exit.
.SS "Date and time format"
The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats include:
.TP 8n
HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.
.TP 8n
HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day names
may be abbreviated.
Note that month and day of the week names must be specified in English.
.TP 8n
CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
ISO time format
.TP 8n
DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
The month name may be abbreviated.
.PP
Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are optional.
If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no time is
specified, the first second of the specified date is used.
The less significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted,
in which case zero is assumed.
.PP
The following are all valid time and date specifications:
.TP 8n
now
The current time and date.
.TP 8n

Exactly one day from now.
.TP 8n
